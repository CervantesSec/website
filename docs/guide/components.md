# Report Components

The report components are the building blocks of a report. They are the elements that are used to display the data in the report. 
The report components are divided into four categories: **Cover**, **Header**, **Footer** and **Body** depending on where they are displayed in the report.

About the available variables you can use in the components, please refer to the [Reference](../reference/index.md) section.
