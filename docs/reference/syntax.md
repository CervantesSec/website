# Syntax

Cervantes uses TinyMCE, is a rich text editor that supports a variety of formats, including HTML and Markdown. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1. **HTML Syntax**: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. In TinyMCE, you can write HTML directly into the editor. For example, to create a paragraph, you can use the `<p>` tag like so: `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`.

2. **Markdown Syntax**: Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Here are some basic Markdown syntax elements that TinyMCE supports:

    - Headers: You can create a header by using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the header. For example, `# Header 1`, `## Header 2`, `### Header 3`.
    - Emphasis: You can make text bold using `**` or `__` around the text, like `**bold text**`. You can make text italic by using `*` or `_` around the text, like `*italic text*`.
    - Lists: You can create an unordered list by using `-`, `*`, or `+`, and ordered lists by using numbers followed by `.`.
    - Links: You can create a link by wrapping link text in brackets `[ ]`, and then wrapping the URL in parentheses `( )`. For example, `[GitHub](http://github.com)`.

In the Cervantes project, TinyMCE is configured with a variety of plugins to enhance its functionality. These plugins include preview, importcss, searchreplace, autolink, autosave, save, directionality, code, visualblocks, visualchars, fullscreen, image, link, media, codesample, table, charmap, pagebreak, nonbreaking, anchor, insertdatetime, advlist, lists, wordcount, help, charmap, quickbars, and emoticons.
