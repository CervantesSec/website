## Security

No technology is perfect, and OWASP Cervantes believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying weaknesses in any technology. If you believe you've found a security issue in our product, we encourage you to notify us. We welcome working with you to resolve the issue promptly.

### Disclosure Policy and Process

* Let us know by submitting the finding through email at ruben.mesquida@owasp.org as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue.
* That "security advisory" will also allow us to have a temporary private fork, to work on the fix in confidentiality.
* Once a fix is ready, we will coordinate a release.
* If you've contributed the fix, you will be credited for it.

> Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder.

### Exclusions

While researching, we'd like to ask you to refrain from:

* Denial of service
* Spamming
* Social engineering (including phishing) of Cervantes staff
* Any physical attempts against Cervantes property or cloud hosted environments

### Safe Harbor

Any activities conducted in a manner consistent with this policy will be considered authorized conduct and we will not initiate legal action against you. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you in connection with activities conducted under this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.
