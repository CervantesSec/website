OWASP is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. Through community-led open source software projects, hundreds of local chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and leading educational and training conferences, the OWASP Foundation is the source for developers and technologists to secure the web.</p> Why build an application like this? <p>Cervantes exists because there are not many applications like Cervantes that assist you in managing your project, clients, reports generation in only one place. Cervantes is a tool that helps you to manage your project and generate reports in a simple way.</p> Deploy options? <p>Cervantes can be deplyoyed in less than a minute via Docker or it can be deployed via the source code.</p> Cervantes support customized templates? <p>Yes. You can create your customized templates and use them in your project. Using the components you can create modular templates and reuse them in your project.</p> Is 2FA supported on Cervantes? <p>Yes, you can set the 2FA with you favourite 2FA app. </p>"},{"location":"license.html","title":"License","text":"<p>This program is free software: You can modify it under the terms of the Apache-2.0 License.

It usually includes the server name, database name, and authentication details. Here's an example of how it might look in your <code>appsettings.json</code>:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"ConnectionStrings\": {\n    \"DefaultConnection\": \"Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;Username=myUsername;Password=myPassword\"\n  },\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Replace <code>myServerAddress</code>, <code>myDataBase</code>, <code>myUsername</code>, and <code>myPassword</code> with your actual database details.</p> <ul> <li>Install Dependencies: The project uses .NET 8.0, so you need to have it installed on your machine. If you don't have it, you can download it from the official .NET website. Once .NET is installed, you can install the project dependencies by running:</li> </ul> <pre><code>dotnet restore\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Build the Project: After the dependencies are installed, you can build the project:</li> </ul> <pre><code>dotnet build\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Run the Project: Finally, you can run the project:</li> </ul> <pre><code>dotnet run --project Cervantes.Web/Cervantes.Web.csproj\n</code></pre> <p>The application should now be running at <code>http://localhost:5000</code>.</p> <p>Please note that this is a basic installation guide and the actual process might vary depending on the project's specific configuration and requirements.

supports a variety of formats, including HTML and Markdown. Here's a brief overview of how it works:</p> <ol> <li> <p>HTML Syntax: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. In TinyMCE, you can write HTML directly into the editor. For example, to create a paragraph, you can use the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag like so: <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Markdown Syntax: Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Here are some basic Markdown syntax elements that TinyMCE supports:</p> <ul> <li>Headers: You can create a header by using the <code>#</code> symbol. The number of <code>#</code> you use will determine the size of the header. For example, <code># Header 1</code>, <code>## Header 2</code>, <code>### Header 3</code>.</li> <li>Emphasis: You can make text bold using <code>**</code> or <code>__</code> around the text, like <code>**bold text**</code>. You can make text italic by using <code>*</code> or <code>_</code> around the text, like <code>*italic text*</code>.</li> <li>Lists: You can create an unordered list by using <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, or <code>+</code>, and ordered lists by using numbers followed by <code>.</code>.</li> <li>Links: You can create a link by wrapping link text in brackets <code>[ ]</code>, and then wrapping the URL in parentheses <code>( )</code>. For example, <code>[GitHub](http://github.com)</code>.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>In the Cervantes project, TinyMCE is configured with a variety of plugins to enhance its functionality. These plugins include preview, importcss, searchreplace, autolink, autosave, save, directionality, code, visualblocks, visualchars, fullscreen, image, link, media, codesample, table, charmap, pagebreak, nonbreaking, anchor, insertdatetime, advlist, lists, wordcount, help, charmap, quickbars, and emoticons.</p> <p>Please refer to the official TinyMCE, HTML, and Markdown documentation for
